# Sponsored Commits (SponCom)

I've got a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/creatorglyph), and I'm attempting
to make the creative effort on the patreon *be* the software that I'm writing,
and not pivot to being a full-time streamer or video editor.  But software
doesn't have an ending credits roll to add patrons' names to, so I've been
trying to find somewhere to put them.

This is my attmept.  As I put it to my existing patrons:

> The way I intend for [rewards] to work is that I'll put all the preferred
> names in a database with a counter equivalent to sponsorship level (so, 1 for
> $1 patrons, 5 for $5 patrons). Each time I write a sponsored commit, I'll run
> the script to give me 3 names and decrement that counter for each of
> them. When everyone is at 0, I'll reset everyone's counter.  So it'll be a
> queue.  Once I've gotten this going I'll update the official reward tier
> descriptions.

So, this is that software.  It's hard-coded to my own details right now, but if
it sounds interesting, feel free to send some PRs.
